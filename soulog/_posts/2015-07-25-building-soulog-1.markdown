My baby project, my beloved "CMS for blogging". I know, I know, "another freaking CMS for blogging". So many (like four) years ago, writing a Wordpress plugin I decided to write my blog starting from scratch. PHP+MySQL seems a reasonable combo but quickly realize the complex of the matter. Developing all that in PHP was driving me mad, PHP was not a language I knew and it was a complex project. Well... It was not that complicated to do some basic working blog, but I wanted to be my baby and not some ugly mosntruosity like the first Wordpress versions.

A year ago, I decided to take the idea and instead of using PHP+MySQL, I choose Go and [Mongodb][Mongodb] (being Mongodb only for rapid development). Go was chosen over other languages mainly because it is a compile language (I got a thing about compiling things). I was messing around with C++, Erlang and Lua when remember a presentation of Go made by a friend. Quickly fell in love with Go, with the ["old school"][GoVsAlgol] design, but updated library and tools. For me, it was beautiful, the feeling I'm writing in some scripting language like Lua or PHP, but being compile like C and structure.

I see Go as a web language, [google][WhyGo] seems to see Go as a big projects language. The structure nature and the simple concurrency makes natural the package interaction in web applications. Why not [node.js][WhyNotNode]? Well... I like to write Javascript as much as I like writing php, love it. The languages are easy, fun to write and get some fast results. If you are a good programmer following style and documenting your code you got no problems with those languages, but the ecosystem that grown around node is a mess, and i see some horrible looking Javascript code. Javascript could stay in the client, I want something trusty on my server.

So... I fell in love with Go, and now I'm here writing some Go and having fun. Uff surely sound like a little boy who knows nothing he's talking about, a year from now I'll come back to this with the though of shame.
